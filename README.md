This is a fork of the original project (By NickAc) for [MS Paint IDE](https://github.com/RubbaBoy/MSPaintIDE/), meant to add utilities and methods solely to add buttons to native window app GUIs.

This is currently depended on in [Paint Injector](https://github.com/RubbaBoy/PaintInjector), which adds action buttons to MS Paint to interact with its IDE (Still a WIP). An example of what this can do:
